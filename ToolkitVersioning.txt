The Terracottta toolkit uses a two part versioning scheme. Given a
particular artifact such as terracotta-toolkit-1.0-runtime-1.0.0.jar
it is fairly evident that there are two version numbers in there (1.0
and 1.0.0) 

The first number (1.0) refers to the version of the toolkit API. The
toolkit conformance kit (TCK) enforces the rules for the API
version. In general all versions 1.x are foward compatible with
respect to previous versions. The only changes allowed when moving
from 1.0 to 1.1 are additions -- existing methods/types/etc cannot be
modified or removed. 

The second number refers to the actual release version of the
toolkit. The very first release of the 1.0 API toolkit will be version
1.0.0. That release will work exclusively with terracotta core version
3.3.0. The release version range of 1.0.0 to 1.0.x is reserved for
changes to the toolkit itself while still being bound to core TC
version 3.3.0. 

When terracotta core 3.3.1 is released the next digit of the toolkit
version will be used. More specifically the range 1.1.0 to 1.1.x will
exclusively work with core TC vesion 3.3.1. 

When the toolkit API changes from 1.0 to 1.1 we can reset the minimum
core version that 1.0.0 works with if we please.
